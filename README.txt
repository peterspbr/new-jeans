Cryptographic system: RSA-4096
Public/Private keys are generated and private key is sent to a cloud based server.
Not only the key will be sent, but the files too.
It will be a 32-bit program. This is needed to ensure compatibility with older devices.
The keys will be encoded with PKCS 8.
Implement Padding in the RSA algorithm.
